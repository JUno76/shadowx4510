Create a program of react JS using React hooks (any one)

To create a React JS app using React hooks in a Vite project, follow these steps. Vite is a modern build tool that offers faster development setups and is optimized for React and other frameworks.

Step 1: Create a React App using Vite
First, create a new React project using Vite.

Install Vite and Create a React Project:

Open your terminal and run the following commands:

bash
Copy
Edit
npm create vite@latest react-hooks-vite --template react
cd react-hooks-vite
npm install
This will:

Create a new Vite project with the React template.

Install the necessary dependencies.

Start the development server:

Run the following command to start the development server:

bash
Copy
Edit
npm run dev
This should start the Vite development server and automatically open the app in your browser at http://localhost:5173.

Step 2: Create the Counter App Using React Hooks
Now, let's modify the App.jsx file to create a simple counter app using React hooks (useState and useEffect).

Modify src/App.jsx:

Open src/App.jsx and replace its content with the following:

jsx
Copy
Edit
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function App() {
  // useState hook to manage the counter state
  const [counter, setCounter] = useState(0);

  // useEffect hook to log a message when the counter value changes
  useEffect(() => {
    console.log(`The counter value has changed to: ${counter}`);
    
    // Cleanup function (runs when the component is unmounted or before re-running useEffect)
    return () => {
      console.log('Cleaning up the counter effect');
    };
  }, [counter]); // Dependency array ensures the effect only runs when the counter changes

  // Function to increment the counter
  const increment = () => {
    setCounter(counter + 1);
  };

  // Function to decrement the counter
  const decrement = () => {
    setCounter(counter - 1);
  };

  return (
    <div className="App">
      <h1>React Hooks Counter with Vite</h1>
      <p>Current Counter: {counter}</p>
      <button onClick={increment}>Increment</button>
      <button onClick={decrement}>Decrement</button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
Step 3: Styling the App (Optional)
You can add some basic styling in the src/App.css file to improve the visual appearance.

Modify src/App.css:

Add the following styles to src/App.css:

css
Copy
Edit
.App {
  text-align: center;
  margin-top: 50px;
  font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
}

button {
  padding: 10px 20px;
  margin: 10px;
  font-size: 16px;
  cursor: pointer;
  background-color: #4CAF50;
  color: white;
  border: none;
  border-radius: 5px;
}

button:hover {
  background-color: #45a049;
}
Step 4: Testing the Application
Run the application:

If you havenâ€™t already, run the development server:

bash
Copy
Edit
npm run dev
Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:5173.

You should now see your React counter app with buttons to increment and decrement the counter. Each time you click the buttons, the counter value will change, and the change will be logged in the browser console.

Step 5: Summary
This React app uses the following hooks:

useState: Manages the state of the counter.

useEffect: Logs the current value of the counter every time it changes. The effect cleans up before re-running, ensuring no memory leaks.

You have now set up a React app with hooks in a Vite project. Vite makes the development experience faster and more efficient compared to traditional React setups.
